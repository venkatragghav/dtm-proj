    			<p>Hey, I’m Cristiano, a 26-year-old footballer from Portugal who’s passionate about the game. I’ve been playing as a forward for years now, and there’s nothing I enjoy more than being on the pitch, scoring goals, and pushing myself to improve. Football is not just a hobby for me—it’s a lifestyle. I love staying fit, training hard, and being part of a team where I can grow alongside my teammates<br>I’m always looking for new opportunities to play, whether it’s joining a weekend match, practicing skills with others, or just meeting new people who share the same love for the sport. If you’re into football as much as I am, let’s connect! I’d love to get involved in local games or even just chat about fitness, strategies, and the best ways to keep improving.</p><br><br>
