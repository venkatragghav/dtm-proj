    			<p>Hi, I’m Virat, a 26-year-old cricketer from India, passionate about batting and leading from the front. I’ve spent years perfecting my skills as a top-order batsman, focusing on consistency, timing, and finishing games under pressure. Whether it’s chasing a tough target or building a solid foundation for the team, I thrive on challenges and always aim to give my best on the field.

				I’m looking to connect with like-minded players who share my love for the game. I’m always up for a good game of cricket, be it a friendly match or a competitive tournament. Cricket, for me, is about hard work, dedication, and enjoying every moment out there. Let’s team up, exchange strategies, or simply hit the nets together!</p><br><br>
